## Overview
This project aims to forecast option prices for stocks listed on the Indian stock exchange by analyzing over 200,000 data points, focusing on 60-day expiry periods for put and call options.

## Models Used
- **Black-Scholes Model:** Utilizes the 2019 risk-free rate of 6.75% from India.
- **LSTM Neural Network:** Employs calculated average volatility for enhanced predictive accuracy.

## Objective
To assess and compare the effectiveness of the LSTM and Black-Scholes models against actual market outcomes, providing insights into their utility in the dynamic Indian stock market.

## Features
- Analyzes a large dataset with a focus on short-term expiry options.
- Compares traditional and modern financial predictive models.
